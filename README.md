### ðŸ§  Brain Tumor Detection App

A machine learning project for real-time brain tumor detection using MRI scans and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model, deployed as an interactive web application with Streamlit.

### ðŸ“Œ Features

- Upload MRI brain scans.

- AI predicts whether a brain tumor is present.

- Displays prediction probability.

- Clean, user-friendly UI with Streamlit.

### ðŸ›  Tech Stack

- Python

- TensorFlow / Keras â€” CNN model

- Streamlit â€” Web interface

- OpenCV â€” Image preprocessing

- Pillow â€” Image handling

- NumPy â€” Array operations

### ðŸš€ Setup Instructions

- Clone or Download the Repository

- git clone <your-repo-url>

- cd brain_tumor_app

### Install Dependencies

- pip install streamlit tensorflow opencv-python pillow numpy


### Place the Model

- Ensure brain_tumor_cnn_model.h5 is inside the project folder.

### Run the App

- streamlit run app.py

### ðŸ–¥ Usage

- Open the app in your browser (usually http://localhost:8501).

- Upload an MRI image (JPG/PNG).

- View the prediction and probability score.

### ðŸ“Œ Model Details

- The model is a CNN trained on MRI brain scan images labeled for tumor presence.

- It uses image preprocessing, convolution layers, pooling layers, and dense layers to make predictions.

### âš¡ Future Improvements

- Deploy online (Streamlit Cloud or Hugging Face Spaces).

- Add multi-class classification for tumor types.

- Integrate a dataset uploader for live model retraining.
